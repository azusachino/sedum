## Personas — five lives, one wiki

### 1. Priya — Staff Engineer (200-person startup)
Knowledge scattered across Confluence, Notion, Slack DMs, and a `~/notes`
folder. Nothing links. During an incident she follows `[[postgres-failover]]`
backlinks to the runbook, the postmortem, and the capacity note, fixes the doc,
and commits all of `miku/` to a private git repo — versioned, diffable notes.
- **Leans on:** backlinks, FTS, plain `.md` on disk (git/rg/sed still work), no lock-in.
- **Before:** real knowledge, unsearchable across five silos; lost on every tool migration.

### 2. Tanaka-san — Records & Compliance Officer (municipal office)
Cloud SaaS is a data-sovereignty and procurement problem. Records must live on
managed, auditable storage and outlive any vendor. Runs Miku on-prem; the files
are the record, Postgres is explicitly disposable. Audit is `git log` over the
notes directory.
- **Leans on:** filesystem-as-truth, self-hosted, no proprietary format, rebuildable index.
- **Before:** forbidden cloud tools, or brittle Word docs in shared drives — no linking, no search.

### 3. Mei — second-year university student
Notes across five courses; the connections exams test get lost. Tags
`#thermodynamics`, links `[[entropy]]`. Two weeks before finals she revises by
*following the graph* through backlinks instead of re-reading everything.
- **Leans on:** tags, backlinks-as-revision-tool, dead-simple textarea capture.
- **Before:** linear Google Docs; no way to see how concepts connected.

### 4. Lucas — freelance investigative journalist
Sensitive source notes; cloud sync is a liability. Works offline. Builds a web
of `[[person]]` / `[[shell-company]]` pages; backlinks reveal who connects to
whom. FTS finds the half-remembered quote. Nothing leaves the machine.
- **Leans on:** local-only, offline, zero cloud dependency, FTS over a large corpus.
- **Before:** wouldn't trust Notion with sources; or an un-cross-referenceable folder.

### 5. Aiko — novelist / worldbuilder
A series with hundreds of characters and timelines that must stay consistent.
Every character is a page; changing `[[Kaelen]]`'s backstory surfaces every
scene that references him via backlinks. Manuscript and wiki are the same plain
files.
- **Leans on:** dense linking, backlinks-as-consistency-check, tags, large-graph performance.
- **Before:** spreadsheets + a wiki SaaS she'd pay forever just to keep reading her own world.

## What the personas change about the design (the rework)

| Tension from the stories | Design response |
|---|---|
| Mei & Lucas need frictionless capture | Keep v0 textarea, but make **quick-create / quick-open (fuzzy by title)** a first-class flow. |
| Aiko & Lucas have large, dense graphs | Non-negotiable: never recompute the graph on a keystroke; paginate/virtualize backlinks. |
| Tanaka-san needs the rebuildable-index promise *provable* | "Drop DB → rebuild from files" is a real command someone can run — that demo *is* the compliance sale. |
| Everyone also edits files outside the editor (git pull, sed, another machine) | The `notify` watcher as the sole index trigger makes external edits reindex identically. Single-writer holds. |
| Priya wants git-native notes | Falls out of files-on-disk. Say it out loud; build nothing. |

**Deliberately deferred** (named to keep scope honest): no mobile app (browser
is the surface), no real-time collab (single-writer, single-user), no built-in
encryption (filesystem/disk's job), no cloud sync (git's job). Every persona is
satisfied *without* these — signal the v0 scope is right.

## The commercial — "Notes you'll still own in 2040"

**Problem:** Knowledge tools are rented, siloed, and trapped in formats you
can't read without the vendor. When the subscription lapses, your second brain
is held hostage — and your real tools (git, grep, your editor, your backup)
can't touch the data.

**Why Miku — your wiki is just Markdown files; Miku is the lens, not the cage:**
- **You own the files.** Plain `.md` in one folder. Delete Miku tomorrow; your knowledge is untouched.
- **Connections, found for you.** `[[links]]` → backlinks, tags, FTS built in the background. The valuable graph, without hand-maintenance.
- **The database is disposable, on purpose.** Postgres is a cache; nuke it and Miku rebuilds from files. Nothing important lives anywhere but your disk.
- **Self-host or run local.** No account, no telemetry, no cloud.
- **It gets out of your way.** Browser editor over a textarea. No bundler, no app to learn, no migration the day you need it most.

**One line:** *Obsidian's linking and a real search engine — but the files are
unarguably yours, and the index is something you can throw away.*

## Product name — Miku

The project is named **Miku** (初音ミク) — Hatsune Miku, the iconic Vocaloid
voice bank and cultural figure in music/tech. Like the Vocaloid engine itself,
Miku lets you compose and shape knowledge without vendor lock-in: the *content*
(Markdown files) is the source of truth, and Miku is the tool layer that renders,
links, and searches — ephemeral and replaceable.

## What we learn from Notion and Obsidian

### From Notion (the polish & onboarding playbook)
- **The empty state is the product.** Notion never shows a blank page — it shows
  templates and a "/" menu that teaches the tool. Miku's first run should seed a
  welcome page that *demonstrates* `[[links]]` and `#tags`, not an empty textarea.
- **The "/" command palette** turns a blank box into a discoverable surface. A
  Miku command bar (`Ctrl-K`: quick-open, new page, search) is the single
  highest-leverage UI affordance — it serves Mei's capture and Priya's navigation at once.
- **Bidirectional context is shown, not summoned.** Notion surfaces related
  content inline. Miku's backlink panel should always be visible, not a click away.
- **What NOT to copy:** the proprietary block model and DB-as-truth. That's
  exactly the lock-in Miku exists to refuse. Notion's data is the cage; ours is files.

### From Obsidian (the local-first, file-owned playbook — our closest sibling)
- **Files-on-disk is a feature users evangelize**, not a technical detail.
  Obsidian's whole trust story is "it's just Markdown in a folder." Miku shares
  this DNA — lean into it as the headline, like they do.
- **`[[wikilink]]` autocomplete is the core interaction.** Typing `[[` and
  fuzzy-picking an existing page (or creating one inline) is what makes linking
  effortless enough to actually do. This is the one interaction Miku must nail.
- **Backlinks + unlinked mentions.** Obsidian shows both explicit backlinks and
  *unlinked* textual mentions — a gentle nudge to connect. Worth considering once
  FTS exists (cheap to compute from the index we already build).
- **Local graph view** is the demo that sells it, even if rarely used daily.
  Defer for v0, but it's the screenshot that makes Aiko's worldbuilding click.
- **Plugins are why it's sticky — and why it's heavy.** Obsidian's power is a
  plugin ecosystem; its cost is a JS-heavy Electron app. Miku's bet is the
  opposite: server-side indexing, no bundler, the browser as a thin client.
  *Don't* chase plugins in v0 — the server-owned index is our differentiator.
- **What NOT to copy:** Electron weight and the sync paywall. Miku is
  self-hosted and uses git for sync — no vault-sync subscription.

### The synthesis
Notion teaches **discoverability** (command palette, never-blank states, inline
context). Obsidian teaches **ownership** (files as truth, frictionless
`[[linking]]`, backlinks as the daily payoff). Miku's wedge is taking
Obsidian's ownership story and moving the *indexing* server-side — so linking,
backlinks, tags, and search are computed for you in the background instead of by
a pile of client plugins, while the files stay plainly, provably yours.

## Feature stance vs Obsidian (decided)

**Adopted as native server features (no plugin system):**
- **Themes** — swappable CSS in `static/` + a `theme` config key. Pure CSS.
- **Homepage** — a `home` config key naming the landing note.
- **Admonitions / Callouts** — post-process blockquotes starting with `[!type]`
  into styled callouts (render + CSS only).

**Frontmatter (first-class):** indexer parses the `---` YAML block. Interpreted
keys are `tags` (merged with inline `#tags`), `aliases` (resolve `[[alias]]` →
page; affects backlinks), `title` (display name). Everything else is indexed as
opaque `key → value` properties (`frontmatter JSONB` on `pages`) — searchable
and the groundwork for a future Dataview-lite query, with no hardcoded schema.

### Rendering: "no JS bundler / server-first" ≠ "zero JS"

> **Latest decision: ADR-7** (`docs/adr/0007-frontend-rendering.md`) — see there.
> Highlights uses **client-side Prism.js** for the MVP; **`syntect` is
> deferred** as a post-MVP swap. The server-side stance below is the *target*,
> not the MVP.

- **Code highlighting → server-side `syntect`.** Highlight at render time into
  classed spans, colored by CSS; themeable via the Themes mechanism. No client
  JS, works with JS disabled.
- **Prism.js → not as an engine.** Reuse only its CSS *class-name convention* so
  existing Prism themes drop into the themes folder. No Prism JS dependency.
- **Mermaid → the one deliberate client-JS exception.** No pure-Rust renderer;
  server-rendering needs node/headless-browser (worse than a script tag). Vendor
  `mermaid.js`, no bundler, and **inject it only on pages the index says contain
  a mermaid block** — every other page stays JS-free. This reframes the v0
  invariant: no *bundler*, not dogmatic zero-JS.

**Deferred:** Dataview-style queries (our Postgres index is the right home for
it later), templates (lightweight `templates/` seed files), daily-notes/calendar
(a date-named-note convention). **Rejected:** a general JS plugin system — that
is the Electron-weight tax Miku exists to avoid.
