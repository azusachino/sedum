# Dataflow & Workflows (v2 — RocksDB queue for 100k-file scale)

This revises the v1 dataflow (`docs/dataflow.md`) to remove Miku's dependency
on a recursive `notify`/inotify watch, which does not survive the 100k-file
scale target (`architecture.md` → *Vault layout & scale*). It introduces a
**RocksDB durable work-queue + read cache** while keeping the core invariant
intact.

## Why this changes (the notify limit)

v1 uses the `notify` watcher as the **sole** index trigger — even for the app's
own saves: a `POST` writes the file, and the resulting `rename` event is what
tells the indexer to reindex. At 10k–100k files a recursive inotify watch
exceeds `fs.inotify.max_user_watches`, so the *trigger mechanism itself* is what
breaks at scale, not Postgres.

The fix is to stop **watching** for app-originated changes and instead have the
save handler **enqueue** its own index work directly. RocksDB backs that queue
durably, so:

- App saves never depend on a filesystem watch → the inotify budget is a
  non-issue for normal editing.
- The queue survives a crash, so startup **drains the queue** instead of
  re-walking 100k files (a full mtime rescan at that scale is exactly the cost
  we want to avoid).
- External edits (git pull, another editor) are caught by a **periodic
  reconcile** scan rather than a live per-file watch.

**Core invariant preserved.** Markdown files under `miku/` remain the source of
truth — saves still atomic-write the file (temp + `fsync` + `rename`) *before*
enqueuing. **RocksDB and Postgres are both disposable caches**, fully
rebuildable from `miku/**/*.md`; deleting either loses nothing but rebuild
time. RocksDB holds two column families: a durable `queue` CF (pending index
work) and an optional `body` read-cache CF (`slug → body + content-hash + mtime`)
that speeds reads and cheap change-detection.

## 2. Rendering model — view vs edit

Reads serve from the RocksDB body cache, falling back to the file on a miss
(then back-filling the cache). Editing is opt-in, no client JS — unchanged from
v1 in spirit.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  V["GET /page/Foo"] --> X{"Foo in RocksDB cache?"}
  X -- hit --> R["render cached body -> HTML"] --> RO["readonly view"]
  X -- miss --> F{"Foo.md exists?"}
  F -- yes --> RB["read file -> back-fill cache -> render"] --> RO
  F -- no --> NEW["offer: create Foo?"]

  RO -->|"click Edit"| E["GET /page/Foo/edit"]
  E --> T["read body -> textarea<br/>(embed content-hash, per ADR-3)"]
  T -->|"Save"| P["POST /page/Foo"]
  P --> S["atomic save + enqueue (see §3)"]
  S --> RD["303 redirect to /page/Foo (view)"]
  RD --> V
```

---

## 3. Save → enqueue → index pipeline

The handler writes the file (truth), mirrors the body into RocksDB, and enqueues
a dirty key — then returns. It **never** indexes. The indexer is woken by an
in-process signal (no polling interval) and drains the durable queue; the queue
is also drained on startup, so nothing is lost across a crash.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant B as Browser
  participant H as axum handler
  participant FS as miku/*.md
  participant R as RocksDB (queue + cache)
  participant I as Indexer
  participant PG as Postgres

  B->>H: POST /page/Foo (markdown body + prior hash)
  Note over H: re-hash file, mismatch results in 409 (ADR-3 optimistic concurrency)
  H->>FS: write Foo.md.tmp + fsync then rename (atomic, truth)
  H->>R: mirror body + hash and enqueue dirty key (WAL fsync)
  H->>I: signal "work available" (in-process)
  H-->>B: 303 redirect to /page/Foo (view)
  Note over H,PG: handler enqueues and does NOT touch the index

  I->>R: pop next dirty key
  R-->>I: Foo (body + hash)
  I->>I: parse title, [[links]], #tags, body_tsv
  I->>PG: reindex transaction (§4 of v1)
  I->>R: mark key done (remove from queue CF)
  Note over I,R: the queue is the trigger — no inotify watch
```

Crash safety: file write commits the truth; if the process dies before the
enqueue, the periodic reconcile (§5) re-detects the change by content-hash. If it
dies after enqueue but before indexing, the durable queue replays on startup.

## 4. FTS search & snippets

Unchanged from v1 and ADR-1: search reads **only** Postgres, snippets via
`ts_headline('english', …)`. The RocksDB body cache is not on the search path —
keeping ADR-1 intact and search a single round-trip.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  SR["GET /search?q="] -->|"body_tsv @@ query (GIN)<br/>ts_headline snippet"| PG[("Postgres")]
  BL["GET /page/Foo/backlinks"] -->|"links.target_id = Foo.id<br/>LIMIT/OFFSET"| PG
  TG["GET /tags/:tag"] -->|"tags.tag = :tag"| PG
```

## 5. External-edit reconciliation (replaces the live watch)

External writes (git pull, another editor) have no `notify` event in v2. A
reconcile task — periodic, manual, and run once at startup — walks the tree and
enqueues anything whose content changed. mtime is a cheap pre-filter only;
**content-hash confirms** the change (ADR-3: mtime lies across git/rsync).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["reconcile (startup / periodic / manual)"] --> B["scan miku/**/*.md"]
  B --> C{"mtime changed?"}
  C -- no --> E["skip"]
  C -- yes --> D{"content-hash ≠ cached hash?"}
  D -- no --> E
  D -- yes --> U["update RocksDB cache + hash<br/>enqueue dirty key"]
  A --> M["page key with no file on disk"]
  M --> X["enqueue delete<br/>(Postgres cascade; inbound links -> dangling)"]
  U --> H["indexer drains queue (§3)"]
  X --> H
```

Trade-off vs v1: external edits are picked up at reconcile cadence, not
instantly. For app-driven editing this is invisible. Deployments that need live
external-edit pickup *and* stay under the watch budget can add a single
**directory-level** watch on the content root (watch dirs, not files) to trigger
a scoped reconcile — optional, off by default.
