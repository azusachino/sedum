# Miku 2.0 — UX Roadmap

> Status: **draft** for review. Supersedes the v0/v1 "make it work" phase. The
> goal of 2.0 is not new storage features — the file-owned index is solid — but
> a **UX the author actually enjoys living in every day.**

## 1. Design thesis

Three principles, distilled from VS Code, Zed, Obsidian, and SilverBullet (the
closest peer — a browser-based Markdown wiki). Every 2.0 decision is measured
against these:

1. **Content is the hero; the chrome fades.** Zed's "less is more" — the UI
   should recede so the note is what you see. Decoration that competes with
   the text is a bug, not a feature. (Zed: *"the UI fades into the
   background"*; VS Code Zen mode.)
2. **One keyboard surface drives everything.** A real command palette +
   quick-switcher is the backbone all four apps share. Mouse-optional, never
   mouse-required. (VS Code: *"all functionality… the same interactive
   window"*; SilverBullet `Cmd-k` / `Cmd-/`.)
3. **Live preview, not modes.** Reading and editing should be the *same*
   surface — Markdown syntax melts away near the text and reappears under the
   cursor. No hard navigation between `/p/X` and `/p/X/edit`. (Obsidian Live
   Preview; SilverBullet's contextual reveal.)

## 2. What each app teaches us

| App | What we borrow | What we skip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SilverBullet** | Live preview in-place editing; `[[ ]]` autocomplete with create-on-click for missing pages; `/` slash commands; `Cmd-k` page switcher; linked mentions at page bottom | Lua end-user scripting / live queries (out of scope for a personal wiki) |
| **Obsidian** | Reading ⇄ editing toggle (`Cmd-E`); **properties** panel (frontmatter as structured fields); quick switcher; linked **and** unlinked mentions | Plugin ecosystem; tabs/panes sprawl; graph as a feature centerpiece |
| **Zed** | Minimalism as a *constraint*; UI recedes; speed is non-negotiable; command palette as the control center; progressive disclosure ("Tesla door handle") | Native/GPU rendering (we're a browser app — borrow the *feel*, not the tech) |
| **VS Code** | Command palette + quick-open as one type-to-filter surface; Zen/focus mode; sensible defaults with optional customization; everything keyboard-reachable | Activity bar / heavy multi-panel workbench |

## 3. Current-state gaps (why the UX feels off today)

- **The "Cmd K" chip is a lie.** It's an `<a href="/search">` — a full page
  navigation, not a palette. There is no quick-switcher and no command palette.
- **Editing is a hard mode-switch.** `Edit` navigates to a separate `/edit`
  route with a split CodeMirror + server-rendered preview pane. Heavy, jarring,
  and nothing like the live-preview peers.
- **Decorative noise competes with content.** Animated background orbs, the
  equalizer logo, gradient glows, and four accent themes pull attention *away*
  from the note — the opposite of the thesis.
- **No editor intelligence.** Plain CodeMirror markdown: no `[[` autocomplete,
  no `/` slash commands, no create-missing-page flow. (An autocomplete endpoint
  was sketched in `frontend_design.md` but never built.)
- **Frontmatter is read-only display.** Properties show as a bullet list; you
  can't edit them without hand-typing YAML in the source.
- **Backlinks only.** We show "linked from" but no *unlinked* mentions.

## 4. The roadmap

Ordered smallest → biggest leverage-to-effort. Each epic is independently
shippable; together they are 2.0.

### Epic 1 — The command surface  ·  _S–M_
The single highest-leverage win. Build a real overlay (Alpine, no bundler):
- **Quick-switcher** (`Cmd-K`): fuzzy-jump to any page by title/path.
- **Command palette** (`Cmd-/` or `Cmd-Shift-P`): new page, toggle theme,
  toggle reading/edit, go to tags, etc. — one surface, type-to-filter.
- Replace the fake search chip; keep `/search` as the full-text results page.
- Needs a lightweight `/api/quickswitch?q=` (titles+paths) endpoint — read-only,
  already trivially indexable from `tb_pages`.

### Epic 2 — Live preview editing (kill the mode switch)  ·  _L_
The structural heart of 2.0. Collapse view + edit into one surface:
- CodeMirror with live-preview decorations: headings/bold/links render styled;
  the active line reveals raw Markdown (Obsidian/SilverBullet model).
- `Cmd-E` toggles a clean **reading view** (no syntax at all) for focused review.
- Drop the split-pane `/edit` route and the server `/preview` round-trip for the
  common case (keep `/preview` as a fallback / for non-JS).
- **Invariant preserved:** still saves atomic `.md`; the watcher remains the
  sole indexer. This is a *frontend* change.
- ⚠️ Biggest lift — see Open Decisions for the scope fork.

### Epic 3 — Editor intelligence  ·  _M_
On top of Epic 2's editor:
- `[[` → page autocomplete; selecting a non-existent page creates it on click
  (SilverBullet's orange-link pattern).
- `/` → slash menu for snippets and formatting (heading, table, callout,
  code block, date).
- Reuse the Epic 1 quick-switch index for `[[` suggestions.

### Epic 4 — Visual calm / minimal chrome  ·  _M_
Make the chrome recede (the core "I don't like the UX" complaint):
- Cut/region the animated orbs, gradient glows, equalizer logo to a single
  tasteful mark. One refined accent, not four competing themes (keep theme
  switching, trim the decoration).
- Establish a real **type + spacing scale** and a reading measure (~65–75ch).
- Add a **Zen/focus mode** (hide sidebar + chrome, center the note) — VS Code
  Zen, toggled from the palette.

### Epic 5 — Knowledge surfaces  ·  _M_
- **Properties panel:** frontmatter as structured, editable fields
  (text/date/list/checkbox), Obsidian-style — writes back to the `.md`.
- **Linked + unlinked mentions:** add unlinked text matches beneath the
  existing backlinks, each one-click promotable to a real `[[link]]`.
- (Stretch) local backlink graph / context snippets.

### Epic 6 — Native-feel polish  ·  _S–M_
Honor Zed's speed principle in a browser:
- Hover-prefetch links; optimistic navigation; zero layout shift; skeletons.
- Audit first-paint weight (we ship Tailwind-in-browser, Prism, Mermaid,
  Alpine, htmx, CodeMirror from CDNs — measure and trim/self-host).

## 5. Non-goals for 2.0

- Multi-user / real-time collaboration (single-writer model stays).
- Plugin/scripting ecosystem (SilverBullet's Lua, Obsidian plugins).
- Mobile-first redesign (responsive polish only).
- Replacing Postgres or the file-owned invariant — **untouched.**

## 6. Open decisions (need a call before Epic 2)

1. **Editor depth.** Full live-preview decorations (SilverBullet-grade, the
   premium feel, large CodeMirror investment) **vs.** a lighter
   "edit-in-place with `Cmd-E` reading toggle" (keeps a visible-syntax editor
   but kills the route switch — ~half the work). *Recommendation: ship the
   lighter version first (delivers 80% of the felt improvement), then layer
   decorations.*
2. **Bundler.** Editor intelligence (Epics 2–3) leans hard on CodeMirror
   extensions. Staying zero-bundler via `esm.sh` works but is fragile at this
   complexity. *Recommendation: keep zero-bundler through Epic 2; reassess a
   minimal build step (esbuild) if Epic 3 friction warrants it.*

## 7. Task breakdown

Canonical, dispatchable task state lives in the asobi graph under the
`miku:ux-2.0` epic (`asobi search "miku:ux-2.0"`). Mirror for reference:

| Task | Title | Status | Dep |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| task-1 | Command surface: `Cmd-K` quick-switcher + `Cmd-/` palette | READY | — |
| task-2 | Live-preview editing: one surface, `Cmd-E` reading toggle | READY* | — |
| task-3 | Editor intelligence: `[[ ]]` autocomplete + `/` slash commands | BLOCKED | task-2 |
| task-4 | Visual calm: recede chrome, type/spacing scale, Zen mode | READY | — |
| task-5 | Knowledge surfaces: editable properties + unlinked mentions | READY | — |
| task-6 | Native-feel polish: prefetch, optimistic nav, trim CDN weight | READY | — |

\* task-2 is gated on the §6 open decisions (editor depth + bundler) before
dispatch. Each task entity carries a `plan:` observation with concrete file
paths and line numbers.
