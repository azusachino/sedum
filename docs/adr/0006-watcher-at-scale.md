# ADR-0006 — Filesystem watcher at scale

## Decision

Keep v1's `notify` watcher as the **sole index trigger**; scale it by watching
**directories, not files**. The watch budget equals **directory count, not file
count**. Three levers, in order:

1. **Recursive `notify` (default)** — one watch per directory; the crate
   auto-registers a watch when a new subdir appears.
2. **Raise `fs.inotify.max_user_watches`** — documented in setup (the standard
   "increase watches" note every IDE ships). Covers the rare deep-tree case.
3. **`PollWatcher` fallback** — zero inotify watches, periodic mtime scan, traded
   for latency. Switched on only past an extreme directory-count threshold
   (archive / `SEDUM_READONLY` territory).

The startup mtime+hash reconcile sweeps anything missed across the new-subdir
registration race or process downtime.

## Why

The 100k-file watch limit was **misdiagnosed**. inotify watches are
**per-directory**, and `notify`'s recursive mode adds one watch per
subdirectory, so a wiki with shallow foldering never approaches the limit (100k
files across ~200 folders ≈ 200 watches; default cap 65k–524k; macOS FSEvents
has no per-file limit at all). The watcher's only irreplaceable job is **live
pickup of external edits** (git pull, another editor) — exactly the
files-are-truth payoff.

## Trade-offs / Rejected

**RocksDB** as a durable work-queue or primary store (the former
`dataflow_v2.md`) is rejected: it solves a problem sedum doesn't have, adds a
second store, and risks the core invariant (files-are-truth). The
event-driven, single-writer v1 model is retained unchanged. See
`docs/dataflow_v3.md` (supersedes v2).
