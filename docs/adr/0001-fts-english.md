# ADR-0001 — Full-text search (Postgres english FTS)

## Decision

Use Postgres' built-in **`english`** FTS config:
`to_tsvector('english', title ‖ body)` with **title weighted A, body B**, ranked
by `ts_rank`, snippets via `ts_headline('english', …)`.

## Why

No extension, no Rust tokenizer, no spike. Postgres stays **vanilla**, so the
index is disposable/portable and identical across compose and k8s. Content and
titles are English in practice; the app name (麒麟草) is branding, not a
content-language requirement. This was the only ADR that needed a spike — it is
eliminated.

## Trade-offs / Rejected

Deferred, not rejected: if meaningful CJK content ever shows up, revisit with
app-side `lindera` tokenization or `pgroonga`. Switching is just a reindex —
cheap, because the index is fully rebuildable from files.
