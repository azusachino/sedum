# ADR-0007 — Frontend rendering & client-JS budget

## Decision

Server-rendered HTML, **no JS bundler**, with a deliberate client-JS budget of
vendored, locally-served (`/static/js/vendor/`, offline-capable) scripts:

- **Alpine.js — interactive widgets only.** The `Ctrl-K` command palette,
  `[[ ]]` / page autocomplete, modals and dropdowns. Alpine holds local DOM
  state and calls the JSON API (`/api/v1/autocomplete`, search). It is **not** a
  general SPA layer — server rendering still owns pages, the read view, the
  index, and the nav explorer (ADR-5).
- **Mermaid.js — lazy, index-flagged.** Injected **only** when the indexer set
  `tb_pages.has_mermaid = true`; every other page stays Mermaid-free. Diagram
  **theme comes from the Themes config**, not hardcoded.
- **Code highlighting — client-side Prism.js, for the MVP.** Prism runs in the
  browser (`Prism.highlightAll()`, triggered via Alpine `x-init` so it re-runs
  after dynamic swaps). Themes are Prism theme CSS in the themes folder.
- **Native server features, no plugin system:** Themes (swappable CSS + `theme`
  key), Homepage (`home` key), Callouts (`[!type]` post-process).
- **Frontmatter first-class:** indexer parses the `---` YAML; interpreted keys
  `tags` / `aliases` / `title`, everything else opaque `frontmatter JSONB`.

## Why

Obsidian's power-via-plugins is also its Electron-weight tax; Miku's wedge is
server-owned indexing with the browser as a thin client. "No *bundler*" keeps
that promise while allowing a few vendored `<script>` tags. The palette and
autocomplete are genuinely interactive (keyboard, debounced fetch, dynamic
lists) — server rendering cannot do them, so Alpine earns its place. Prism is
chosen for the MVP because it is near-zero backend work (two tags + a call),
letting the MVP ship the editor/index/search first.

## Trade-offs / Rejected

- **Prism reverses `product.md`'s server-side `syntect` decision** — accepted
  consciously for MVP speed (latest decision wins). **Cost:** code blocks FOUC
  until JS runs, and JS-disabled / `MIKU_READONLY`-published readers get no
  highlighting. **`syntect` is deferred, not rejected:** the post-MVP path is
  highlight-at-save + cache rendered HTML by content hash (ADR-2), serving
  JS-free classed HTML. Revisit when the publish / no-JS persona is in scope.
- Rejected: a general JS plugin system (the Electron tax); MDX/JSX (ADR-2).
- Deferred: Dataview-style queries, templates, daily-notes.
