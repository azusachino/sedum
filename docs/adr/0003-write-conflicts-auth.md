# ADR-0003 — Write conflicts & auth

## Decision

**Write conflicts — optimistic concurrency.** The edit view embeds the file's
**content hash** as a hidden field; `POST` recomputes the hash before renaming.
If it changed since load → **409 Conflict** with a "file changed underneath you"
prompt (show both versions). Cheap (one read+hash before rename), guards the
*file*, never involves the indexer. Hash over mtime (mtime is coarse and lies
across `git`/`rsync`).

**Auth — no user system.** Sedum stays **single-user and login-less**; network
protection is the *deployment's* job. Two modes cover every persona:
`SEDUM_READONLY` (view-only, no write routes) for publishing, and a writable
network deploy behind an authenticating reverse proxy.

## Why

Last-write-wins (atomic rename) can silently clobber two tabs or a browser edit
racing a `git pull`. The content-hash 409 is the minimal guard consistent with
the single-writer model. Accounts/RBAC reinvents Notion and breaks "keep it
simple."

## Trade-offs / Rejected

**Loro / CRDTs — considered, deferred.** Loro solves concurrent multi-writer /
offline merge — a problem Sedum deliberately doesn't have. Its authoritative
state is an operation log that can't be reconstructed from a plain `.md`
snapshot, so it **conflicts with files-are-truth**. It becomes the right choice
*only if* we commit to real-time collaborative editing — at which point it earns
its own ADR.
