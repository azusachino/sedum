# ADR-0005 — Navigation explorer (folder/file tree)

## Decision

A Quartz-style collapsible **explorer** in the sidebar, rendered **server-side**
from `tb_pages.path` using native `<details>`/`<summary>` — **zero client JS, no
schema change**. Folders are derived **path-prefixes**, not rows; the tree is a
pure function of the existing index, so the read path stays **Postgres-only**
(consistent with the single-writer, read-only-handler model).

## Why

Fits the decided frontend stance (`product.md` → *"no JS bundler / server-first"
≠ "zero JS"*): Mermaid is the **one** deliberate client-JS exception; everything
else stays server-rendered. `<details>` gives collapse/expand for free, works
with JS disabled, no bundler. `tb_pages.path` already encodes the hierarchy.

**Physical folders, not tags.** The explorer's job is **spatial orientation**
("where does this file live"), which folders answer directly. A tag-hierarchy
tree (`#area/sub`) is a *different* view and can ship later at `/tags` reusing
the same `<details>` renderer over `tb_tags`. Folders stay the "loose filing
cabinet"; the explorer makes it navigable.

**Scale.** Full server-render for typical vaults; past a threshold, render top
levels collapsed and **lazy-load** children on expand from `/tree?prefix=…`.
Never emit 100k nodes eagerly. Active page's ancestor folders get `open`.

**Ordering.** Folders-before-files, alphabetical (free from a `BTreeMap` walk).
Frontmatter `order`/`nav` hints deferred.

## Trade-offs / Rejected

(1) A client-side JS tree widget — reintroduces the bundler/Electron tax ADR-0002
and `product.md` exist to avoid. (2) A `tb_folders` table — folders are derivable
from `path`; materializing them duplicates truth and invites drift.
