# ADR-0004 — Rename / delete & assets

## Decision

**Rename = first-class operation.** `POST /page/rename` (1) atomically renames
the file, (2) finds referrers via `tb_links.target_id`, (3) rewrites
`[[Old]]→[[New]]` in each referrer through the normal atomic-save path
(preserving aliases). Each rewrite fires `notify` → normal reindex. The one
operation that writes many files — best-effort at FS level; partial failures
self-heal via startup reconcile. UX: "this will update N backlinks" confirm.

**Delete = soft-delete with 7-day archive.** The file is **moved to
`sedum/.trash/<original-path>@<deleted-at>.md`**; `.trash/` is excluded from the
watcher and index, so the page vanishes from search/backlinks at once (row
removed, inbound links go dangling via `ON DELETE SET NULL`) while the bytes
survive. GC purges trash older than **`SEDUM_TRASH_TTL` (default 7 days)**.
Restore = move the file back → reindex.

**Assets.** Live in `sedum/assets/`; upload writes atomically, deduped by content
hash (`name-<short-hash>.ext`). `![[image.png]]` resolves by basename. Orphans
are **reported, never auto-deleted** (auto-GC of user files violates
files-are-truth) — `tb_links(kind='asset' AND is_embed)` minus disk.

## Why

A bare rename leaves every `[[OldName]]` dangling; `notify` as the sole trigger
keeps both the link-rewrites and the file move on the normal reindex path. Trash
lives inside the content root so it travels with backups/PVC, but is
ignore-listed to keep the live index pure.

## Trade-offs / Rejected

No new asset table — asset targets already live in `tb_links`. Auto-deletion of
orphan assets rejected outright.
