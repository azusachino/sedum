# Design Decisions (ADRs)

Resolutions to the open design corners. Each is a decision, not code. Mirrored
in asobi (`sedum:decision:*`). See `architecture.md` for the prose design.

> **Status:** ADR-1 … ADR-5 below are **verified** and now canonical in
> `docs/adr/` (`0001`–`0005`). This file is the **draft/staging** pool for
> proposed decisions; the verified copies in `docs/adr/` win on any conflict.

---

## ADR-1 — Full-text search (English)

**Decision.** Use Postgres' built-in **`english`** FTS config:
`to_tsvector('english', title ‖ body)` with **title weighted A, body B**, ranked
by `ts_rank`, snippets via `ts_headline('english', …)`. Content and titles are
English in practice; the app name (麒麟草) is branding, not a content-language
requirement.

**Why this is now trivial.** No extension, no Rust tokenizer, no spike. Postgres
stays **vanilla** so the index is disposable/portable and identical across
compose and k8s. This was the only ADR that needed a spike — it's eliminated.

**Deferred, not rejected.** If meaningful CJK content ever shows up, revisit with
app-side `lindera` tokenization or `pgroonga`. Switching is just a reindex —
cheap, because the index is fully rebuildable from files.

## ADR-2 — Markdown & wikilink grammar

**Renderer — `comrak`.** `comrak` (Rust cmark-gfm) provides, as built-in
extension options: GFM (tables, strikethrough, task lists, footnotes,
autolinks), **native wikilinks** (`[[Target|Display]]`), and **native GitHub
alerts** (`> [!NOTE]` callouts). That keeps custom grammar work to two
extractors — `#tags` and `![[embed]]` — that the renderer does not provide
natively. Render speed is acceptable for a personal wiki, and rendered HTML can
be cached by content hash later if needed. No MDX/JSX (rejected — JS runtime,
breaks portability; `sedum:decision:no-mdx`).

**Editor vs renderer — CM6 is a separate axis.** CodeMirror 6 is a *client-side
editor*; it does **not** render the read view or feed the index — the server
still parses Markdown (comrak) for both. What CM6 buys is the *editing*
experience: in-editor syntax highlighting and a natural home for `[[ ]]`
autocomplete and live preview. So: **comrak for server-side render/index now;
CM6 for the editor (roadmap)** — orthogonal, not either/or.

**Tag grammar.** `#tag` where tag = Unicode letters/digits plus `_ - /` (so
hierarchical `#area/health` works). Recognized only in text (not code, URL
fragments, or `# ATX headings`); `#` immediately followed by a tag char, no
space. Stored whole (`area/health`); ancestor grouping (`area`) is a
**query-time prefix match**, not index-time expansion.

**Callouts — conflict resolved:** Obsidian/GitHub `> [!type]` wins (now *native*
via comrak alerts); `:::` directive syntax dropped; `architecture.md` updated.
**Transclusion** `![[Page]]` / `![[image.png]]`: custom, server-side, with a
recursion/cycle depth limit (roadmap render; grammar fixed now).

---

## ADR-3 — Write conflicts & auth

**Write conflicts.** Saves are atomic rename = last-write-wins, so two tabs (or
a browser edit racing a `git pull`) can silently clobber. **Decision: optimistic
concurrency.** The edit view embeds the file's **content hash** as a hidden
field; `POST` recomputes the hash before renaming. If it changed since load →
**409 Conflict** with a "file changed underneath you" prompt (show both
versions). Cheap (one read+hash before rename), guards the *file*, and never
involves the indexer — consistent with single-writer. Hash over mtime (mtime is
coarse and lies across `git`/`rsync`).

**On CRDTs (`loro-dev/loro`) — considered, deferred.** Loro is excellent
rich-text CRDT tech, but it solves *concurrent multi-writer / offline merge* — a
problem Sedum deliberately doesn't have (single-user, single-writer). The deeper
blocker: it **conflicts with files-are-truth**. A CRDT's authoritative state is
its operation log, which cannot be reconstructed from a plain `.md` snapshot, so
adopting it forces a fork — either the oplog becomes canonical (breaking "just
Markdown files you own") or we keep two sources of truth and must pick a winner.
**Decision: keep the content-hash 409.** Loro becomes the right choice *only if*
we commit to real-time collaborative editing, at which point it reshapes the
core invariant and earns its own ADR. Not a single-user need.

**Auth — no user system.** Sedum stays **single-user and login-less**; network
protection is the *deployment's* job. Two modes cover every persona:
- **`SEDUM_READONLY`** (roadmap flag) — serves view-only, no edit/save routes.
  For publishing; no auth needed because nothing writes.
- **Writable network deploy** — put Sedum behind an **authenticating reverse
  proxy** (oauth2-proxy / basic auth / Tailscale). Documented, not built.

Building accounts/RBAC is explicitly rejected — it reinvents Notion and breaks
"keep it simple." Local-first personas bind to localhost and need nothing.

---

## ADR-4 — Rename/delete & assets

**Rename = first-class operation, not a bare file move.** A bare rename leaves
every `[[OldName]]` dangling. **Decision:** `POST /page/rename` (1) atomically
renames the file, (2) finds referrers via `tb_links.target_id`, (3) rewrites
`[[Old]]→[[New]]` in each referrer through the normal atomic-save path
(preserving display aliases: `[[Old|Disp]]→[[New|Disp]]`). Each rewrite fires
`notify` → normal reindex. Honest caveat: this is the **one operation that
writes many files** — best-effort at the FS level; partial failures are
self-healed by the startup reconcile. UX: a "this will update N backlinks"
confirmation before committing.

**Reindex is automatic for both.** `notify` is the sole index trigger
(architecture invariant), so the rename's link-rewrites and the file move each
fire fs events → normal reindex. No handler indexes directly.

**Delete = soft-delete with a 7-day archive.** Deleting never `rm`s immediately.
The file is **moved to `sedum/.trash/<original-path>@<deleted-at>.md`**, and
`.trash/` is **excluded from the watcher and index** — so the page vanishes from
search/backlinks at once (its row is removed; inbound links go dangling via
`ON DELETE SET NULL`), while the bytes survive. A periodic GC purges trash
entries older than **`SEDUM_TRASH_TTL` (default 7 days)**. **Restore** = move the
file back → `notify` → reindex. Trash lives *inside* the content root (so it
travels with backups and the k8s PVC) but is ignore-listed, keeping the live
index pure. UX: a "N backlinks will dangle" warning before deleting.

**Assets.** Live in `sedum/assets/`. Upload (roadmap): `POST /assets` writes
atomically, keeping the original name but **deduping by content hash**
(`name-<short-hash>.ext`) to avoid collisions. `![[image.png]]` resolves by
basename in `assets/`; served with caching headers.

**Orphan assets — never auto-deleted.** Auto-GC of user files violates
files-are-truth (an asset may be referenced from outside Sedum, or kept
deliberately). Instead, a **report**: assets on disk minus
`tb_links(kind = 'asset' AND is_embed)` = unreferenced. Manual cleanup only. No
new table — asset targets already live in `tb_links`.

## ADR-5 — Navigation explorer (folder/file tree)

**Decision.** A Quartz-style collapsible **explorer** in the sidebar, rendered
**server-side** from `tb_pages.path` using native `<details>`/`<summary>` —
**zero client JS, no schema change**. Folders are derived **path-prefixes**, not
rows; the tree is a pure function of the existing index, so the read path stays
**Postgres-only** (consistent with the single-writer, read-only-handler model).

**Why no JS.** This fits the decided frontend stance (`product.md` → *Rendering:
"no JS bundler / server-first" ≠ "zero JS"*): Mermaid is the **one** deliberate
client-JS exception; everything else stays server-rendered. `<details>` gives
collapse/expand for free, works with JS disabled, and needs no bundler.

**Why physical folders, not tags.** A tag-hierarchy tree (`#area/sub`) is more
"on-brand" per `architecture.md` ("the graph carries the meaning"), but the
explorer's job is **spatial orientation** — "where does this file live" — which
folders answer directly. Folders remain the "loose filing cabinet"
(`architecture.md`); the explorer just makes that cabinet navigable. A
tag-tree is a *different* view and can ship later at `/tags` reusing the same
`<details>` renderer over `tb_tags`.

**Scale.** Full server-render for typical vaults (hundreds–low thousands). Past
a threshold, render top levels collapsed and **lazy-load** a folder's children
on expand from a small `/tree?prefix=…` endpoint — never emit 100k nodes
eagerly (same "never load the full set at once" rule as backlinks). The active
page's ancestor folders get `open`; siblings stay collapsed.

**Ordering.** Folders-before-files, alphabetical (free from a `BTreeMap` walk,
`title.is_none()` first). Frontmatter `order`/`nav` hints are **deferred** — not
needed for v0.

**Rejected.** (1) A client-side JS tree widget — reintroduces the bundler/Electron
tax ADR-2 and `product.md` exist to avoid. (2) A `tb_folders` table — folders
are derivable from `path`; materializing them duplicates truth and invites
drift. Mirrored in asobi `sedum:decision:nav-explorer`.

## ADR-6 — Filesystem watcher at scale

> **Status: Verified** → canonical in `docs/adr/0006-watcher-at-scale.md`. Lifts
> the `dataflow_v3.md` resolution into a decision so the RocksDB detour is not
> re-litigated.

**Decision.** Keep v1's `notify` watcher as the sole index trigger; scale it by
watching **directories, not files**. Watch budget = directory count, not file
count. Three levers in order: (1) recursive `notify` (one watch per directory,
default); (2) document raising `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` in setup; (3) a
`PollWatcher` fallback (zero inotify watches, periodic mtime scan) past an
extreme directory-count threshold. The startup mtime+hash reconcile sweeps any
events missed across the new-subdir registration race or process downtime.

**Why.** The 100k-file watch limit was **misdiagnosed**: inotify watches are
**per-directory**, and `notify`'s recursive mode adds one watch per subdirectory,
so a wiki with shallow foldering never approaches the limit (100k files in ~200
folders ≈ 200 watches; default cap 65k–524k; macOS FSEvents has no per-file
limit). The watcher's only irreplaceable job is **live pickup of external
edits** — exactly the files-are-truth payoff.

**Rejected.** RocksDB as a durable work-queue / primary store (former
`dataflow_v2.md`) — solves a problem sedum doesn't have, adds a second store,
and risks the core invariant. See `docs/dataflow_v3.md` (supersedes v2).

## ADR-7 — Frontend rendering & client-JS budget

> **Status: Verified** → canonical in `docs/adr/0007-frontend-rendering.md`.
> **Supersedes** `product.md`'s server-side `syntect` highlighting choice
> (latest decision wins). Source plan: `docs/frontend_design.md` (agy),
> reconciled.

**Decision (summary).** Server-rendered, **no JS bundler**, with a client-JS
budget of vendored, locally-served libraries:

- **Alpine.js** — interactive widgets only (`Ctrl-K` palette, `[[ ]]`
  autocomplete, modals); calls the JSON API. Not a general SPA layer.
- **Mermaid.js** — lazy, injected only when `tb_pages.has_mermaid`; theme from
  config, not hardcoded.
- **Code highlighting → client-side Prism.js for the MVP** — a conscious
  reversal of the server-side `syntect` plan, accepted for MVP speed. Cost: FOUC
  + no highlighting for JS-disabled / published readers. **syntect deferred** as
  a post-MVP swap (highlight-at-save + cache).
- Native server features (Themes/Homepage/Callouts), first-class frontmatter —
  unchanged.

See the ADR for full rationale and the deferred-syntect note.

## ADR-8 — Theme switching

> **Status: Verified** → canonical in `docs/adr/0008-theme-switching.md`.
> **Extends ADR-7** (Themes + Alpine budget); ADR-7 is immutable, so the
> switcher is a new decision.

**Decision.** A theme switcher on **two orthogonal axes**, both persisted to
`localStorage` (per-browser display prefs, not content):

- **Palette:** `default` | `catppuccin` → `data-palette` on `<html>`.
- **Mode:** `system` | `light` | `dark` → resolved to a `data-mode` of
  `light`/`dark` on `<html>`. `system` reads `prefers-color-scheme` and a
  `matchMedia` listener live-updates on OS flip.

CSS is **custom-variable sets** selected by the attribute pair — four base
combinations: `default+light`, `default+dark`, `catppuccin+light` (Latte),
`catppuccin+dark` (Mocha). `[data-palette="catppuccin"][data-mode="dark"]`
overrides the `--vars`; everything (callouts, links, code) reads the variables.

**Mechanics.** (1) A tiny **inline pre-paint script** in `<head>` sets
`data-palette`/`data-mode` from `localStorage` before first paint — avoids the
theme flash (FOUC). (2) **Alpine** drives the dropdown + persistence + the
`matchMedia` listener. (3) The server `theme` config key (ADR-7) supplies the
**default** when no saved pref. (4) **Prism** code themes are swapped to match
the resolved palette+mode (Catppuccin ships official Prism themes).

**Why.** Palette and mode are genuinely independent, and the Catppuccin family
maps exactly onto the mode axis (Latte = light, Mocha = dark), so it inherits
System/Light/Dark for free — "Catppuccin + System" = Latte by day, Mocha by
night with zero extra UI. Fits the decided no-bundler + Alpine stance.

**Trade-offs / Rejected.** Four CSS variable sets to maintain (and matching
Prism themes). One new inline pre-paint `<script>` — justified by FOUC, kept
minimal. `localStorage` is per-browser and **not synced** — acceptable for a
display preference. Rejected: a flat single-list of themes (loses the
palette×mode independence the user chose); server-side per-user theme storage
(no user system — ADR-3). Candidate verified file:
`docs/adr/0008-theme-switching.md`.
